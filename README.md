# unity-android-native-camera

On this repository you'll find and experiment to draw the Native Android Camera feed onto a Unity GameObject.

The starting point comes from [Unity Technologies NativeRenderingPlugin](https://bitbucket.org/Unity-Technologies/graphicsdemos/src/364ac57cea5c197ca9b7015ba29dcc1ff94c9f61/NativeRenderingPlugin/).

The folder structure contains the following:
* [An NDK library as the low level rendering plugin](NativeCameraPlugin)
* [An Android Studio project to create and AAR library as Unity Native Plugin](UnityAndroidCameraPlugin)
* [Finally, the Unity project to illustrate all the plunbing](UnityAndroidCamera)
